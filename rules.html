Don't claim a crazy amount. Don't name your nation after real places. Declare a government type and tell the Secretary General (SecGen) what it is. Make a unique banner, and give that to the SecGen too.

Similarly, if Kingdom A has ruled over a large area for multiple months or years without dispute, then that area should probably remain theirs.</li>

                            TL;DR: Be a decent human being, both in text and in voice chat. Also you can nick yourself but make sure it's recognizable when compared to your regular username.

                            <li> Don't say slurs in chat. </li>
                            <li> Both a. and b. apply to in-game voice chat as well (for more information on that, see the Plugins section of the Server Info posted below). </li>

                                <li> You may use <code class="TerpCraft">/nickname</code> to give yourself a nickname, but this username must contain some part of your actual username (not just mean letters, but whole words or phrases). For example, if my username is "Testudo", I could shorten it to Testy, but not something like "ILOVETMNT". </li>
